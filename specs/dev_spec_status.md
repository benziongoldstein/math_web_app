## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Target Number Generation
**Algorithm**:
- 20% chance: Generate a large prime number (31-97) for prime recognition
- 80% chance: Generate a composite number (5-100) for factorization
- Return `{value: number, isPrime: boolean}`

**Available Primes for Factorization**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

**Large Primes for Recognition**: 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- Players must identify these as prime using the "It's Prime!" button
- Cannot be factorized using available primes

### 2. Game State Management
**State Object**:
```javascript
{
  screen: 'main' | 'playing' | 'gameOver',
  gameMode: 'normal' | 'simple',     // Selected game mode
  targetNumber: number,
  isPrimeTarget: boolean,             // Is current target a prime?
  selectedPrimes: array,
  currentProduct: number,
  currentIntermediate: number,        // For Simple Mode division tracking
  timer: number (seconds remaining),
  scores: {
    correctFactors: number,           // Counts both factorizations AND prime identifications
    undoCount: number
  },
  gameStarted: boolean,
  countdownActive: boolean
}
```

### 3. Prime Selection Logic
- Store selected primes in array: `[2, 3, 2, 5]`
- Calculate product: `reduce((acc, val) => acc * val, 1)`
- Display as equation: `array.join(' × ') + ' = ' + product`
- Each prime in equation is clickable for undo

### 4. Undo Logic
- Click a prime in the equation (e.g., "2" in "2 × 3 × 2 × 5")
- Find last index of that prime in selectedPrimes array
- Remove that element
- Recalculate product
- Update display
- Increment undo count
- Play undo sound

### 5. Timer Implementation
- Use `setInterval` to decrement timer every 1000ms
- Update display each second
- On reaching 0, clear interval, end game
- Show score screen

### 6. Success Detection
- On each prime selection, check if `currentProduct === targetNumber`
- If match:
  - Trigger success animation
  - Play success sound
  - Increment correct factors score
  - Clear selected primes
  - Generate new target
  - Reset equation display
  - Continue game (no pause)

### 7. Prime Recognition Logic
- **"It's Prime!" button** displayed below prime factor buttons
- When clicked:
  - Check if `isPrimeTarget === true`
  - If true: Treat as success (same as factorization success)
  - If false: Do nothing (no penalty for wrong guess)
- Players must recognize when target cannot be factorized
- Timer continues running - no hints provided

### 8. Simple Mode Logic
- **Display**: Shows target and intermediate side by side (both large, prominent)
  - Initial state: `Target: 18    Intermediate: 18`
  - After operations: `Target: 18    Intermediate: 9` (after dividing by 2)
- **Equation Display**: Shows regular multiplication equation below (same as Normal Mode)
  - Example: `2 × 3 = 6` (shows PRODUCT, not intermediate)
  - Used for undo functionality (click primes in equation)
- **Prime Selection**:
  - Check if `currentIntermediate % prime === 0` (divides evenly)
  - If yes: Update `currentIntermediate = currentIntermediate / prime`
  - If yes: ALSO update `currentProduct = calculateProduct(selectedPrimes)` for equation display
  - If no: Do nothing (silent rejection)
- **Success Detection**: When `currentIntermediate === 1`
- **Undo**: 
  - Multiply `currentIntermediate` by the removed prime
  - Recalculate `currentProduct` for equation display
- **UI Changes**: 
  - Show two large numbers side by side at top (target + intermediate)
  - Show equation display below (same as Normal Mode, for undo)
  - Update target display area to show both target and intermediate values

## Known Constraints & Considerations

### Constraints
1. Target numbers: 80% composite (5-100, factorable by primes ≤ 29), 20% large primes (31-97)
2. 1-minute total game time (not per number)
3. No backend/database (all client-side)
4. Must work in modern browsers

### Considerations
1. **Performance**: Ensure smooth experience even with rapid clicking
2. **Audio**: Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio
3. **Random Generation**: May need efficient algorithm to avoid regenerating many times
4. **Accessibility**: Consider keyboard navigation (future enhancement)
5. **Mobile**: Touch events may need special handling (optional for v1)

## Current Blockers / Issues

### Issues Identified & Resolved

1. **"How to Play" button not working** - Button click doesn't show instructions screen ✅ FIXED
2. **Undo doesn't trigger success** - If player reaches target number by undoing, success event doesn't fire ✅ FIXED
3. **Game over screen not showing scores** - Score board missing or not visible at game end ✅ FIXED (was working, user tested successfully)
4. **GO sound caused countdown to freeze** - Attempted to add "GO!" sound when game starts, but caused countdown to stick on 1. Feature removed, countdown bug fixed. ✅ FIXED
5. **Success screen doesn't pause naturally** - New target appeared immediately after success, felt jarring. Added 600ms delay for better UX. ✅ FIXED
6. **Simple Mode equation shows wrong result** - Equation display in Simple Mode always showed 1 (or wrong value) instead of correct product. Root cause: `currentProduct` wasn't being updated in Simple Mode's `selectPrime()` and `undoPrime()` functions. Fixed by calculating `currentProduct` in both modes. ✅ FIXED
