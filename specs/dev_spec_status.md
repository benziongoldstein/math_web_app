## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Target Number Generation (Updated v1.1)
**Algorithm**:
- 20% chance: Generate a large prime number (31-97) for prime recognition
- 80% chance: Generate a composite number (5-100) for factorization
- Return `{value: number, isPrime: boolean}`

**Available Primes for Factorization**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

**Large Primes for Recognition (v1.1)**: 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- Players must identify these as prime using the "It's Prime!" button
- Cannot be factorized using available primes

### 2. Game State Management (Updated v1.1)
**State Object**:
```javascript
{
  screen: 'main' | 'playing' | 'gameOver',
  targetNumber: number,
  isPrimeTarget: boolean,        // v1.1: Is current target a prime?
  selectedPrimes: array,
  currentProduct: number,
  timer: number (seconds remaining),
  scores: {
    correctFactors: number,      // Counts both factorizations AND prime identifications
    undoCount: number
  },
  gameStarted: boolean,
  countdownActive: boolean
}
```

### 3. Prime Selection Logic
- Store selected primes in array: `[2, 3, 2, 5]`
- Calculate product: `reduce((acc, val) => acc * val, 1)`
- Display as equation: `array.join(' Ã— ') + ' = ' + product`
- Each prime in equation is clickable for undo

### 4. Undo Logic
- Click a prime in the equation (e.g., "2" in "2 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 5")
- Find last index of that prime in selectedPrimes array
- Remove that element
- Recalculate product
- Update display
- Increment undo count
- Play undo sound

### 5. Timer Implementation
- Use `setInterval` to decrement timer every 1000ms
- Update display each second
- On reaching 0, clear interval, end game
- Show score screen

### 6. Success Detection
- On each prime selection, check if `currentProduct === targetNumber`
- If match:
  - Trigger success animation
  - Play success sound
  - Increment correct factors score
  - Clear selected primes
  - Generate new target
  - Reset equation display
  - Continue game (no pause)

### 7. Prime Recognition Logic (v1.1)
- **"It's Prime!" button** displayed below prime factor buttons
- When clicked:
  - Check if `isPrimeTarget === true`
  - If true: Treat as success (same as factorization success)
  - If false: Do nothing (no penalty for wrong guess)
- Players must recognize when target cannot be factorized
- Timer continues running - no hints provided

## Known Constraints & Considerations

### Constraints (Updated v1.1)
1. Target numbers: 80% composite (5-100, factorable by primes â‰¤ 29), 20% large primes (31-97)
2. 1-minute total game time (not per number)
3. No backend/database (all client-side)
4. Must work in modern browsers

### Considerations
1. **Performance**: Ensure smooth experience even with rapid clicking
2. **Audio**: Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio
3. **Random Generation**: May need efficient algorithm to avoid regenerating many times
4. **Accessibility**: Consider keyboard navigation (future enhancement)
5. **Mobile**: Touch events may need special handling (optional for v1)

## Current Blockers / Issues Found During Testing

### Issues Identified - Oct 14, 2025

1. **"How to Play" button not working** - Button click doesn't show instructions screen âœ… FIXED
2. **Undo doesn't trigger success** - If player reaches target number by undoing, success event doesn't fire âœ… FIXED
3. **Game over screen not showing scores** - Score board missing or not visible at game end âœ… FIXED (was working, user tested successfully)
4. **GO sound caused countdown to freeze** - Attempted to add "GO!" sound when game starts, but caused countdown to stick on 1. Feature removed, countdown bug fixed. âœ… FIXED
5. **Success screen doesn't pause naturally** - New target appeared immediately after success, felt jarring. Added 600ms delay for better UX. âœ… FIXED
