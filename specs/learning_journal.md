## Questions & Answers

### Day 1: October 11, 2025

#### **Q1: What is this file structure? (Folders and files in the project)**
**Asked**: During specification review

**Answer**: 
The file structure is how we organize all the files in our project. Think of it like organizing a house - each folder (room) has a specific purpose:

- **index.html** = The "front door" - the main page that opens in the browser
- **css/** = The "interior decorator" folder - makes everything look pretty (colors, sizes, layout)
- **js/** = The "brain" folder - contains all the logic and behavior files:
  - `main.js` = The coordinator (connects everything)
  - `game.js` = Game logic (generates numbers, checks answers, tracks score)
  - `ui.js` = Updates what you see on screen
  - `audio.js` = Plays sounds
  - `utils.js` = Helper functions
- **assets/** = The "storage room" - media files (sounds, images)
- **specs/** = The "planning documents" - what to build and how

**Why organize this way?**
1. Easy to find things (need to change a sound? Go to `assets/sounds/`)
2. Each file has ONE job (easier to understand)
3. Professional standard (how real developers work)

## Concepts Explained

### What is HTML?
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the structure of a web page.

**Simple analogy**: If a website was a house...
- HTML = The walls, doors, windows (structure)
- CSS = The paint, decorations, furniture (style)
- JavaScript = The electricity, plumbing, smart features (behavior)

**Example**:
```html
<button>Click Me</button>
```
This creates a button with the text "Click Me".

### What is CSS?
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** makes things look good.

**Example**:
```css
button {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```
This makes all buttons blue with large text.

### What is JavaScript?
**JavaScript** makes web pages interactive and adds behavior.

**Example**:
```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
});
```
This makes something happen when you click a button.

## Step-by-Step Learning

### Phase 1: Setup & Structure (Not Started)

#### Step 1: Create Folder Structure
**What we'll learn:**
- How folders organize projects
- Why we separate different types of files
- How to create files and folders

**What we'll do:**
- Create folders: `css/`, `js/`, `assets/sounds/`, `assets/images/`
- Create empty files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, JavaScript files
- See how everything connects

*(Steps will be added as we go)*

## Today I Learned (TIL)

### October 11, 2025
- âœ… **File structure organization**: Why and how to organize project files
- âœ… **Separation of concerns**: HTML (structure), CSS (style), JavaScript (behavior)
- âœ… **Project planning**: Writing specifications before coding
- âœ… **Development phases**: Breaking a big project into manageable steps

#### **Q2: What is JS?**
**Asked**: End of Day 1

**Answer**: 
**JS = JavaScript** (it's just the short form)

JavaScript is the programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. 

In our game:
- JS generates the random numbers
- JS checks if your answer is correct
- JS makes the timer count down
- JS plays sounds when you click
- JS does all the "thinking" and game logic

**Simple way to remember**: JS is the "brain" of your website that makes things happen.
